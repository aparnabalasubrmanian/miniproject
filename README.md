# Title
Energy Optimization in Smart Grids through Predictive Modelling and Explainable AI

# About
This project develops an intelligent energy optimization system using machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI) to improve energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions and operational costs. By analyzing historical and meteorological data, it provides transparent forecasts and insights, aligning with SDG 7 to support sustainable energy use across various settings.

## Data Extraction and Preprocessing:
- Extract historical energy data from Kaggle and meteorological data from OpenWeatherMap.
- Clean and normalize data to handle inconsistencies.
- Perform feature engineering to enhance data relevance for model training.

Data Storage and Management:
- Use MongoDB to store processed data, ensuring efficient management and retrieval.
- Organize data into collections for energy and meteorological information to support model training and analysis.
- Enable scalability and flexibility in data storage to accommodate future expansion and diverse data sources.

Data Analysis:
- Analyze consumption patterns and trends using machine learning models like XGBoost and Random Forest.
- Examine correlations between energy usage and external factors such as temperature and humidity.
- Utilize Explainable AI (XAI) tools like SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions, offering clear insights into influential variables.
